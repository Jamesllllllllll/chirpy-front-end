# Chirpy

This is a front-end for a social media platform called Chirpy. The [backend is written in Go](https://github.com/Jamesllllllllll/chirpy), hosted on fly.io. The front-end is hosted on Vercel along with a Neon Postgres database.

This project is started from the [Learn HTTP Servers in Go](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-http-servers-golang) course on Boot.dev. Then I added the ability to add images to chirps after completing the [Learn File Servers and CDNs with S3 and CloudFront](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-file-servers-s3-cloudfront-golang) course. Images added to Chirps are stored in an S3 bucket and served via CloudFront.
